## 1. What is ISAIDNO

ISAIDNO is an automated system consisting of a Local Regulated Swiss Compliant Escrow Account on OKex, along with a series of ERC20 smart contracts which define decentralized tokens representing the locally deposited assets in a 1:1 ratio, also known as “wrappers” -- NOBTC and NOUSDT.

## 2. What is NOUSDT and NOBTC

NOUSDT is a wrapped token representing USDT and BTC, respectively, assets held in escrow on the OKEx exchange. Using an automated system to match a trader's OKEx transfer with their external Ethereum address, tokens are minted automatically to the Ethereum address as soon as USDT or BTC is transferred into the escrow account.

## 3. How do you get NOUSDT and NOBTC Tokens?

OKEx users who are interested in converting internal OKEx USDT and BTC tokens into NOUSDT and NOBTC can use our [website](https://www.isaidno.ooo).

## 4. How do you convert NOUSDT and NOBTC Tokens into OKEx USDT and BTC Tokens

Token Holders must complete a full KYC and AML approval with Capital Finance & Trust Co. (1923) SA in order to convert their assets to the underlying BTC or USDT value. In the event that withdrawals resume normal functionality, token holders will have the opportunity to choose if they want to be credited internally within OKEx or to an external wallet under their control. The minimum amount to convert is 1000 NOUSDT or 0.1 NOBTC.
